	abstract = {In the collaborative landscape of data analysis, a common frustration among analysts stems from the need to integrate and harmonize different programming languages within a team. Teams often comprise interdisciplinary researchers, each with their unique programming preferences and expertise, leading to complexities in project integration and continuity. The difficulty in compiling and executing data projects cohesively can hinder efficiency and impede the delivery of coherent, multi-faceted data insights. This challenge necessitates a solution that can bridge the gaps between varying coding languages and methodologies to streamline team collaboration and project completion.},
