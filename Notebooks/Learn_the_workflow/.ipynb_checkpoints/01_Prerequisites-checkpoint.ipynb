    "The goal of this workflow is, in short, to share what we have learned. But also to provide as much context and guidance as possible so this research does not sit on a shelf somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we are going to create a knowledge repository. However, in order to do that, it will take a little bit of work upfront. You are going to have to spend some time learning some new things. I assure you though the hard work will have a great payoff. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow demonstrated here works well with both Python (like this notebook) but also with R. Infact, Quarto (our open source technical publishing system) is going to eventually replace R-markdown. \n",

    ">- **R and RStudio:** Use RStudio for R-based data analysis and creating R Markdown documents. These can also be integrated into Quarto.\n",
    ">- **Quarto:** Use Quarto to compile Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown documents into a cohesive set of documentation and reports. Quarto can generate static websites, PDFs, and more.\n",
    ">- **GitHub:** Host your data repository on GitHub. Use GitHub for version control and collaboration. Host your Quarto-generated documentation and wiki on GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.\n",
    ">- **CyVerse/AWS (Cloud Storage):** Store large files that cannot be accommodated on GitHub. Use CyVerse or AWS S3 to host these files and generate URLs for access. Include these URLs in your Quarto documentation, Jupyter Notebooks, and R Markdown files to provide seamless access to the data."
